    "### Variables\n",
    "To set a variable, use the following syntax `<var_name>=<var_value>`. The shell does not care about types of variables; they may store strings, integers, real numbers.  \n",
    "Another thing to note is that if we access an undeclared variable, we do not get an error, instead empty string is returned. To access an already decalred variable, prefix it with a dollar sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Export Command** Suppose we set a variable `NAME` like:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$NAME=Adam\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we create a bash script:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "# variable_scope.sh\n",
    "echo \"NAME is ＄NAME\"\n",
    "NAME=Steve\n",
    "echo \"NAME is ＄NAME\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the following output:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$./variable_scope.sh\n",
    "NAME is\n",
    "NAME is Steve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because whenever we run a bash script in this manner it spawns a new shell to run the script. That new shell doesn't know about the variable declared in the parent shell. To make child shells aware of any variable declared in parent shell we need to export that variable. If we just type `export` we can see a list of already exported variables:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$export\n",
    "declare -x PWD=\"/home/salmananjum/bash_scripting\"\n",
    "declare -x SHELL=\"/bin/bash\"\n",
    "declare -x SHLVL=\"1\"\n",
    "declare -x TERM=\"xterm-256color\"\n",
    "declare -x USER=\"stevejobs\"....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the above example, we need to export the `NAME` variable:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$export NAME=Adam\n",
    "$./variable_scope.sh\n",
    "NAME is Adam\n",
    "NAME is Steve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source Command** one thing to notice in the previous example is that once the script is run, if we check the value of `NAME` variable, we get:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$echo $NAME\n",
    "Adam\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The change made to the `NAME` variable was limited to that particular shell instance, it didn't reflect in the parent shell. In order to receive environment changes back from the script, we must source the script - this effectively runs the script within our own interactive shell, instead of spawning another shell to run it.\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$source variable_scope.sh\n",
    "NAME is Adam\n",
    "NAME is Steve\n",
    "$echo $NAME\n",
