    "## Outbox Pattern\n",
    "This pattern is useful when we want to write to a database and publish message to a queue as one transaction. Either both operations succeed or neither do. As an example, lets say we have an *Order Service* that needs to do two things simultaneously:\n",
    "- Update its local database by setting order status as \"SHIPPED\"`\n",
    "- Notify other services (e.g., the Billing Service or Notification Service) by publishing a message (\"Order Shipped Event\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible failure scenarios:\n",
    "- if the database was updated, but publishing message failed then the other services never know the order shipped leading to data loss\n",
    "- if we publish the message first but fail to write to the database, then the other services act on incorrect information leading to data inconsistency\n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce *retry* on failure, but what if the hardware crashed? We would not be able to retry or even perform the second action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** involves introducing a second table called *outbox* table that records all the message publish actions that need to be performed. Then we combine writing to database and the outbox table in one transaction:"

    "## Duplicate Messages\n",
    "Message brokers look for an acknowledgment from the consumer to mark message as being processed successfully. If the acknowledgement is not received, the same message can be sent again.

    "- Tracking message: every message is marked with a unique identifier before being pushed to the queue. The consumer gets message from the queue and it checks its local database to verify if the message was previously received and processed. If it was, the message is simply discarded. If it was not, the message is consumed and the message status is set as processed or done.\n",
