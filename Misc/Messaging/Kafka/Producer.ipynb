    "- `StringSerializer`: used to serialize string keys and values. It converts a string to `byte[]` using the specified encoding.\n",

    "- `JsonPOJOSerializer`: used to serialize Java POJO keys and values as JSON `byte[]`. It uses library like Jackson\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioner\n",
    "Partitioner is responsible for determining which partition a specific `ProducerRecord` should be sent to within a topic. Partitioners help distribute message across partitions acting as load balancer. It also ensures message ordering if required (by sending similar messages to same partition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioner works in the following manner:\n",
    "1. If the `ProducerRecord` explicitly specifies a `partition` number, the Partitioner simply uses this value.\n",
    "2. If the `partition` is not specified, but a `key` is present in the `ProducerRecord`, the Partitioner uses a hashing algorithm on the key.\n",
    "3. If both the `partition` and the `key` are `null`, the Partitioner's goal shifts to simply distributing the load as evenly and efficiently as possible. A round-robin algorithm will be used to balance the messages among the partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it means that **it is the producer's responsibility to decide which partition to send data to**."
