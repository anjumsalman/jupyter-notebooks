    "Key *game* would expire in 10 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add `EX` option to specify a timeout while defining a value (only available for `SET`):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ SET game valorant EX 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Expiration is done by associating a key with Unix timestamp and then checking the system time. if you set a key with a time to live of 1000 seconds, and then set your computer time 2000 seconds in the future, the key will be expired immediately, instead of lasting for 1000 seconds.\n",

    "What happens when volatile-* policy is selected, but there are no keys with expiry set? The behaviour would be similar to noeviction. Why choose volatile-* instead of allkeys-*? Because some keys represent critical data (like a user's session state) that should never be deleted unless explicitly told to. Theys keys are set without expiration time.\n",

LRU samples a small number of keys at random and then evicts the ones with the longest time since last access. LFU uses a probabilistic counter, called a Morris counter to estimate the object access frequency using just a few bits per object.\n",
