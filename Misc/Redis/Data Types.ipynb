    "## STRING\n",
    "The String data type is used to store String, Integer and Floating point numbers. The basic operations associated with STRING are `GET`,`SET` and `DEL`.\n",

    "$ SET greeting Hello\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ SET greeting Hi NX\n",
    "(nil)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys can also be assigned a TTL using `EX <seconds>` option:\n",

    "OK\n",
    "$ EXISTS short-lived\n",
    "(integer) 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the same STRING type is used to represent Integers and Floating type data, we have number specific commands. Note that a nonexisting key or blank string is equivalent to 0. The cli commands `INCR`, `DECR`, `INCRBY`, `DECRBY`\n",

Redis list is implemented as linked list, so adding new elements is faster than accessing an ith index element. Redis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it is crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way. \n",

    "The `LRANGE` command includes the end index. Specifying index out of bounds does not produce an error.  If start is larger than the end of the list, an empty list is returned. If stop is larger than the actual end of the list, Redis will treat it like the last element of the list. -ve offset values are also accepted:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking Operations:** consider a producer consumer setup where the producer and consumer write to/ read from the same list. Produces pushes to the list, whereas consumer pops from the list. What happens when the list is empty? The consumer can try to repeatedly poll the list for presence of new items it can pop. However, the better way is to use the blocking `BRPOP` and `BLPOP` commands.\n",
