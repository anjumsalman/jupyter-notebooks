    "## Overview\n",
    "Redis transactions let us execute multiple statements in a single step. But is it ACID compliant?\n",
    "- **Atomicity:** Redis doesn't provide the same type of atomicity gurantee as traditional RDBMS. Explained later.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Redis ensures internal data consistency by only allowing valid operations on its native data structures.\n",
    "- **Isolation:** Redis is single threaded internally. This naturally provides high level of transaction isolation. This is similar to serializable isolation level. Other isolation level are not available.\n",
    "- **Durability:** As an in-memory database, Redis doesn't provide durability out of the box. But there are varying level of persistence options available.\n",

    "## Transaction\n",
    "A Redis transaction is created using the `MULTI` command. Subsequent commands are queued for execution and then executed in one step when `EXEC` command is run:\n",

    "OK\n",

    "An error can be encountered during different phases:\n",
    "- Syntax error or out of memory error before `EXEC` is run. In this case no command would be run.\n",

    "```\n",
    "- Error happening after `EXEC` is run. In this case, some commands would get executed and others fail. There is no rollback.\n",
