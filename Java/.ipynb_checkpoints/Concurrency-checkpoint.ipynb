    "**Thread Interference:** two operations consist of multiple steps, and the sequences of steps overlap. As in the counter example above.  \n",
    "**Memory Inconsistency:** errors occur when different threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data.\n",

    "**Synchronized Methods** whenever we add `synchronized` keyword to a method, the method can only be executed by one thread at a time. The counter program can be rewritten by using synchronized methods as:\n",

    "\n",
    "It should be noted that Constructors cannot be synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synchronized Blocks** synchronization is built around the concept of *locks*. Before a thread can execute a synchronized method, it must own the lock associated with it. In case of synchronized methods, that lock is `this` reference. This can be better illustrated by rewriting the above methods as:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class SharedObject {\n",
    "    private long counter = 0;\n",

    "One possible problem with synchronized method is that out of all the synchronized methods of an object instance, only one method can be run at a time. In the above example two different threads therefore cannot execute two different synchronized methods at the same time. Therefore, in certain scenarios where we we want to modify two completely unrelated data in an object, we make use of synchronized blocks with multiple locks for more granular control over concurrent access:\n",
