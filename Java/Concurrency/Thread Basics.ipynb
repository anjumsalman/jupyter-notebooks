    "Thread notification works on the idea that a thread needs certain condition to be exist and that some other thread will create that condition. Three methods of `Object` class provide this mechanism:\n",
    "- `wait()` : waits for a condition to occur. Must be called from within a `synchroized` method/block. Calling `wait` gives up the lock.\n",
    "- `wait(long timeout)`: similar to the first except that it comes back into contention for the lock acquisition after the timeout.\n",
    "- `notify()`: signals a random waiting thread (guarded by the same lock) to that the condition has occurred. This also must be called from within `synchronized` block/method. Calling `notify` doesn’t mean lock is given up.\n",
    "- `notifyAll()` : notifies all waiting threads (guarded by the same lock) instead of an arbitrary thread. The notified threads take turn to acquire lock and continue from `wait`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since any Java object can be used as lock, it makes sense that the `Object` class contained these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, it is imperative that `wait` and `notify` methods are called from within `synchronized` - this is to prevent race condition associated with *wait-and-notify* mechanism:\n",
    "1. Thread A tests a condition and discovers it must wait.\n",
    "2. Thread B sets the condition and calls `notify()` to inform A to resume execution. Because A is not yet waiting, nothing happens.\n",
    "3. Thread A waits, by calling `wait()`.\n",
    "4. Because of the prior `notify()` being missed, A waits indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
