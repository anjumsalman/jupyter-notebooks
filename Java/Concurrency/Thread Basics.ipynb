Wait (and its overloaded variants) forces a thread to wait and notify signals a waiting thread that it can continue execution. Both methods must be called from within a synchronized block. Synchronized block because of the inherent race condition:\n",

    "The thread that calls wait (the waiting thread) and the thread that calls notify (the notification thread) must compete for the same lock. Either thread must call wait or notify via the same object on which they enter their synchronized contexts because wait tightly integrates with the lock. Prior to waiting, a thread executing wait releases the lock, which allows the notification thread to enter its synchronized context to set the condition and notify the waiting thread. Notify on the other hand doesn't release any lock. Since any Java object can act as lock, the wait and notify methods are the Object class' methods."
