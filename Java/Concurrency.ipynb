    "\n",
    "It should be noted that Constructors cannot be synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synchronized Blocks** synchronization is built around the concept of *locks*. Before a thread can execute a synchronized method, it must own the lock associated with it. In case of synchronized methods, that lock is `this` reference. This can be better illustrated by rewriting the above methods as:\n",

In the above example two different threads therefore cannot execute two different synchronized methods at the same time.

    "2. process each task in a separate thread (separating those into even smaller tasks if necessary)\n",
