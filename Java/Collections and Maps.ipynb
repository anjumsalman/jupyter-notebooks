It is used as whenever in any bucket the number of nodes becomes more than this threshold value, the data structure of that bucket is converted from linked-list to balanced tree. This change is done to make put-get operations faster as the linked-list provides $O(n)$ time complexity whereas the time required to traverse the balance tree is $O(log n)$ ."
