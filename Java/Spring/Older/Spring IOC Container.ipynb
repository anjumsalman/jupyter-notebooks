    "### Introduction\n",
    "Before diving into IOC container, we need to know what a **Spring Bean** is. A Spring Bean is an object created, managed and destroyed by Spring. There are some other terms which we may be familiar with like **Java Bean** and **POJO**. A Java Bean is an object which\n",
    "1. has all properties private\n",
    "2. has public getter and setters\n",
    "3. has public no-args constructor\n",
    "4. implements Serializable interface  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, POJOs are just Plain Old Java Objects with not guidelines as to how they should be constructed. Spring can manage just about any object, even if it doesnâ€™t have JavaBean type characteristics such as default constructors or mutator methods (getter/setter).  \n",

    "The `org.springframework.beans` and `org.springframework.context` packages are the basis for Spring Framework's IoC container."
