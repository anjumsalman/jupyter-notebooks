    "## Netflix Eureka\n",
    "Is a service discovery solution helpful in client-side load balancing scenarios, though it can be used for other purpose as well, for example in *Spring Cloud Gateway*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "The Eureka ecosystem consists of the following actors:\n",
    "- **Eureka Server:** a server where microservices can register themselves so others can discover them\n",
    "- **Eureka Service:** any application that can be found in the Eureka Server's registry and is discoverable by others\n",
    "- **Eureka Instance:** a single instance of a service (a Eureka Service can have multiple instances?)\n",
    "- **Eureka Client:** any application that can discover services OR registers itself to the Eureka server\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "The digram below explains the Eureka Client/ Server setups fairly well:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/raw/master/images/eureka_architecture.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure high availability, the Eureka Server is replicated across zones (and also regions). More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "Since Eureka is a client/server model, it accepts different sets of configuration for client and for the server. By default, Eureka searches for property file `eureka-client.properties` or `eureka-server.properties` in the classpath. Since a Eureka Server would also act as a client (to communicate with other Eureka Servers), it would need both configurations."

    "### Registering Service\n",
    "If `eureka.client.register-with-eureka` is set to true, an instance registers with a Eureka server using the given URL. Multiple instances can belong to the same service. An instance is identified in Eureka by `eureka.instance.instanceId` or, if not present, `eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId`. If both are not specified, it defaults to `CLIENT IP:PORT`. The instances find each other using `eureka.instance.appName` (identifier for a service), which Spring Cloud defaults to `spring.application.name` or UNKNOWN, if the former is not defined.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a client registers with Eureka, it provides meta-data about itself — such as host, port, health indicator URL, home page, and other details. It does that by making a POST REST API call to the Eureka Server. The instance information is represented by `InstanceInfo` object. The `InstanceInfo` is sent to the Eureka server at regular intervals, starting at 40s after startup (configurable by `eureka.client.initialInstanceInfoReplicationIntervalSeconds`), and then onwards every 30s (configurable by `eureka.client.instanceInfoReplicationIntervalSeconds`). Note that this is different from sending heartbeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Heartbeat\n",
    "After registering itself with Eureka Server, an instance sends heartbeats every 30s (configurable by `eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds`). If the server doesn’t receive a heartbeat, it waits 90s (configurable by `eureka.instance.leaseExpirationDurationInSeconds`) before removing the instance from registry and there by disallowing traffic to that instance. Sending heartbeat is an asynchronous task; if the operation fails, it backs off exponentially by a factor of 2 until a maximum delay of `eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds` * `eureka.client.heartbeatExecutorExponentialBackOffBound` is reached. There is no limit to the number of retries for registering with Eureka.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Health Check\n",
    "By default, Eureka uses the client heartbeat to determine if a client is up. Unless specified otherwise, the client does not propagate the current health check status of the application, per the Spring Boot Actuator. Consequently, after successful registration, Eureka always announces that the application is in 'UP' state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By enabling Eureka health checks, the client application will send health status (the same health status reported by actuator/health endpoint of Actuator framework) to the Eureka server, and server will use this status to determine if server should advertise hostname/IP of this particular application to other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetch Registry\n",
    "If `eureka.client.fetchRegistry` is true, the client fetches the Eureka server registry at startup and caches it locally. From then on, it only fetches the delta (this can be turned off by setting `eureka.client.shouldDisableDelta` to false, although that’d be a waste of bandwidth). The registry fetch is an asynchronous task scheduled every 30s (configurable by `eureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds`). If the operation fails, it backs off exponentially by a factor of 2 until a maximum delay of `eureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds` * `eureka.client.cacheRefreshExecutorExponentialBackOffBound` is reached. There is no limit to the number of retries for fetching the registry information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Cache\n",
    "To reduce number of registry fetch requests made to the server, the client caches registry information on its end. This helps with availability in-case Eureka Server goes down. However it has the drawback that it can report services being available (for some time - till cache is refreshed) even though the service was down."

You can disable peer awareness by setting `eureka.client.register-with-eureka` to false.\n",

Doing so makes Eureka publish instance information that shows an explicit preference for secure communication.
