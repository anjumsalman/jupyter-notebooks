    "## Bulkhead Pattern\n",
    "A typical Tomcat container provides 200 threads that handle user request. Now suppose one of the upstream service starts misbehaving and all the calls to this service start experiencing high latency. Any call to our service that relies on misbehaving service would get stuck. This will soon lead to all our Tomcat threads getting saturated by network call to the misbehaving service:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/thread_saturation.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure in one service leads to cascading failure in other service. One way to solve the issue, is to use a dedicated thread pool to make the dependency service call. Every dependency would have its own fixed thread pool and instead of making the request on Tomcat thread, the request is made using the dependency's dedicated thread. In a simplistic implementation where we have *x* Tomcat threads and there are *n* dependencies, each dependency can use its own threadpool with *x/n* threads. This would mean if a dependency misbehaves, at max *x/n* Tomcat threads would be blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/bulkhead.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we use Tomcat with virtual threadpool? Is Bulkhead still relevant? Yes, because Bulkhead can also be used to guard access to a limited resource. Let's say we have two have two APIs both of which connect to a database. Usually database connections are limited resource and is pooled. If one API makes long running slow SQL queries, slowly it will use all the database connections, leaving none for the second API which usually made fast queries."

    "If a certain number of calls to a dependency fails in a given time period, there is no point making additional calls to the same service. Circuit breaker does exactly the same, in open state any call going through the circuit breaker to downstream service would immediately fail and get routed to the fallback method. Circuit breaker has 3 states:\n",
    "- Closed: normal state, all calls are permitted\n",
    "- Open: when the amount of failure exceeds a predefined threshold, circuit breaker transitions to open state and no call passes through. This allows the affected downstream service a chance to recover without being overwhelmed by incoming calls\n",
    "- Half Open: after the set cooldown period, a few calls are permitted to check if the downstream service is bacak up, or still down. If the call succeeds, the circuit breaker returns back to closed state, else it stays in open state.\n",
