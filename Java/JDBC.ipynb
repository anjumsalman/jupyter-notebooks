    "### How a Connection is Made?\n",
    "Most of the jdbc identifiers like `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`, etc are interfaces. The driver provides the actual implementation. For example:\n",
    "- Connection(I) -- T4CConnection (C)\n",
    "- Statement(I) -- OracleStatement(I) -- T4CStatement(C)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is snippet of how a connection is obtained\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void main(String args[]){\n",
    "    String url = someUrl;\n",
    "    String username = \"myuser\";\n",
    "    String password = \"mypassword\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try{\n",
    "        Class.forName(\"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\");        \n",
    "        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);\n",
    "    } catch(SQLException e){\n",
    "        e.printStackTrace();\n",
    "    } catch(ClassNotFoundException e){\n",
    "        e.printStackTrace();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first statement `Class.forName` searches for the class in the CLASSPATH and if found, executes the static initializer block in that class. The static initializer code registers the driver with `DriverManager` using `DriverManager.registerDriver`. Now whenever a call to `DriverManager.getConnection` is made, the DriverManager searches among registered driver and returns appropriate connection object.  \n",
    "Since JDBC 4.0, Class.forName is not required, DriverManager itself does that bit."

    "### DataSource and Connection Pool\n",
    "Before we discuss DataSource, we should be aware of JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). And before we discuss JNDI, we need to know about naming services. A naming service is a mapping between a name and object (or reference to the object). For example, DNS (Domain Name Server) is a naming service which maps a URL to the IP address of the host. Similarly, LDAP is another naming server. The problem is that each naming service has its own naming convention. For example, DNS has names like `www.google.com`, whereas LDAP has name like `cn=Steve Jobs, o=Contose, c=US`. JNDI utilises a consistent naming convention and provides a common interface to existing naming services.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**JNDI** Central to JNDI are:\n",
    "- `Name` class which represents an ordered sequence of subnames\n",
    "- `Context` interface which represents a set of bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "Concrete implementation of Context interface must provide implementations for binding, unbinding, renaming, listing all bindings, etc. A context may also have subcontexts. `IntialContext` is an implementation of Context interface and  serves as our entry point to a naming system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**InitialContext** The InitialContext constructor takes a set of properties, in the form of a Hashtable or one of its subclasses, such as a Properties object.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Properties props = new Properties(); \n",
    "props.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \"com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory\"); \n",
    "props.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, \"file:///\"); \n",
    "Context initialContext = new InitialContext(props);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY` property states the factory class in a JNDI service provider. In simpler terms it specifies the naming service we are trying to use. The rest of the properties are naming server specific and may include things such as password.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Context is ready, we can use it to lookup the name object mapping:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Object obj = initialContext.lookup(name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "**DataSource** ConnectionManager is a lower level API, DataSource on the other hand is higher level and the main advantage of using DataSource is that it provides *Connection Pooling* and *Distributed Transactions*. On bigger projects DataSource should be the preferred way of connecting to the database. The DataSource interface is implemented by a driver vendor and the driver vendor can:\n",
    "- create a basic implementation with no connection pooling or distributed transaction\n",
    "- create implementation supporting the above listed features\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big advantage of using DataSource is that you can use it in conjuntion with JNDI, therefore database connection details are hidden away. A datasource object can be created and mapped in JNDI or you can do that in your server's admin console:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Create datasource\n",
    "BasicDataSource ds = new BasicDataSource();\n",
    "ds.setServerName(\"development\");\n",
    "ds.setDatabaseName(\"CUSTOMERS\");\n",
