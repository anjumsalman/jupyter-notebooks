If asynchronous processing on the associated request is started, then the response object remains valid until `complete` method on `AsyncContext` is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "Containers commonly recycle response objects in order to avoid the performance overhead of response object creation. The developer must be aware that maintaining references to response objects for which `startAsync` on the corresponding request has not been called, outside the scope described above may lead to non-deterministic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closure of Response Object:** The following events indicate that the servlet has satisfied the request and that the response object is to be closed:\n",
    "- termination of the service method of the servlet.\n",
    "- amount of content specified in the `setContentLength` or `setContentLengthLong` method of the response has been greater than zero and\n",
    "has been written to the response.\n",
    "- `sendError` method is called.\n",
    "- `sendRedirect` method is called.\n",
    "- `complete` method on `AsyncContext` is called."
