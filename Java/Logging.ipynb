    "### Ecosystem\n",
    "Java logging ecosystem consists of `sl4j` and one of many logging frameworks like `log4j`, `logback` or inbuilt Java logging classes. SL4J provides abstraction for various logging frameworks, a bunch of interfaces stating how logging should be done. The logging frameworks provide the actual implementation. The idea is that anyone can switch to his own logging framework of choice by swapping in required jars. Another reason is that library authors want to log the steps being performed by their library but have no idea what logging framework the client maybe using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some logging frameworks (like log4j) don't really need sl4j, but it is preferable to use it alongwith sl4j. In this case a sl4j-log4j adaption layer is required. Logback on the other hand is fully based on sl4j. The below diagram explains the  scenario:\n",
