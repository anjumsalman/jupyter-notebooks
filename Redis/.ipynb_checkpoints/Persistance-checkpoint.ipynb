    "Since Redis stores data in memory, it needs to write it to disk in order to recover data in case of crash or restart. The data transferred to the disc must be an exact copy of data in memory. But how do we achieve that? Suppose there are $n$ key value pairs at time $T_1$ when the data copy was started. Now during the copy process one of the key value pair can be modified. So there may be situation like $a$ amount of key values are same as they were at $T_1$, but $b$ number of key value pairs got updated and reflect the value they have at $T_2$.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Possible solution:\n",
    "- lock the entire database during the copy process\n",
    "- make use of `fork`\n",
    "\n",
    "The fork system call spawns a new child process and make two identical copies of address spaces, one for the parent and the other for the child. Since both the parent and child process now share the same physical memory block this is not an expensive operation.  \n",
    "![Fork](https://i.imgur.com/W8i80Mb.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now when an update is made to the existing key value pair during copy, the updated key value pair gets a new memory location. Using this method at the maximum, double memory will be required.  \n",

    "`fsync` is a system call which transfers data from kernel buffer to disk cache. The final step is writing data to the disk, which we don't have control over. Fsync is expensive operation and it will block the process for all the time needed to complete the write. To conclude:\n",
    "- Data written to kernel buffers using the write system call (or equivalent) gives us data safety against process failure (Redis crashes).\n",

    "Alternate persistance mode. In this mode all the commands (only if they have some effect on actual data) coming to Redis is first written to a file. Now in case of abrupt power loss or crash, the file is played back to bring system back to its original state. There is a possibility that the aof file becomes too big. Redis will simply rewrite aof file from scratch in a temporary file by directly accessing data in memory, so that Redis can create the shortest AOF that is possible to generate.
