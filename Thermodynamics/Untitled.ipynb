    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control Volume** : the space under observation. For a control volume, it's just the boundary of the volume that is fixed, the volume of fluid inside the control volume can change, over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control Mass** : if a control volume has constant mass, it is control mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Surrounding** : everything external to control volume\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties and State\n",
    "**Phase** : quantity of matter which is homogeneous throughout. Some examples:\n",
    "- liquid water + water vapor = two phases (different structural properties)\n",
    "- liquid oil + liquid water = two phases (different chemistries)\n",
    "- gas oxygen + gas nitrogen = one phase (miscible solution)\n",
    "- liquid water + liquid methanol = one phase (as a miscible solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each phase can exist in its own **state**. Each state is described by macroscopic **properties**. Some examples of properties:\n",
    "- temperature\n",
    "- pressure\n",
    "- density\n",
    "\n",
    "If a property depends upon mass it is **intensive** else it is **extensive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties describe the state of the system only when it is in **thermodynamic equilibrium**."
