    "## Overview\n",
    "Encryption process that uses the same *encryption key* for encryption and decryption. To perform encryption, we:\n",
    "- select an appropriate encryption method (a *cipher*)\n",
    "- generate an encryption key\n",
    "- generate an *initialization vector*\n",
    "- select a cipher *operation mode*\n",
    "- select a *padding type*\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform encryption using the above listed items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tools just need a password to encrypt - such a tool derives an encryption key using password and generates all the above prerequisites in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric encryption provides:\n",
    "- **Confidentiality:** Only the holders of the encryption key can decrypt and view the original data.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Suitable for encrypting large data volume quickly.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Single key for both encryption and decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not provide:\n",
    "- **Integrity:** does not ensure that the ciphertext has not been altered. If an attacker modifies the ciphertext, the decryption might still work, producing altered or invalid data.\n",
    "- **Authentication:** does not inherently authenticate the sender or verify that the message came from a legitimate source.\n",
    "- **Non-Repudiation:** Non-repudiation ensures that a sender cannot deny having sent a message. Symmetric encryption does not provide this, as both the sender and receiver have access to the same key and can produce the same ciphertext.\n",

    "Operate on blocks of data. For example, if the *block size* is 128 bits, then 128 bits of data is encrypted at a time. If the amount of data is larger than the block size, then the data is broken into multiple chunks. If plaintext is not multiple of block size, the last block is padded using the selected *padding type*.\n",

    "Encryption algorithms are often measured in terms of *security bits*. If an attacker needs to perform $2^{256}$ computational\n",
    "operations to break a cipher, then the *cipher security* is 256 bits. In a brute force attack, all possible keys are tried, therefore if an encryption key is 256 bits long, it will $2^{256}$ possible combinations that needs to be tried - representing the $2^{256}$ computations mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer keys need more computational power to encrypt/decrypt, however the difference is not big for symmetric encryption. Not all ciphers are as strong as the encryption key length.\n",

    "### Cipher Operation Modes\n",
    "Block ciphers can operate in different *encryption modes*, also known as *modes of operation*. Examples listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Electronic Code Book mode (ECB):** each block is encrypted using just the encryption key and then concatenated. Initialization vector is not used. The same plaintext results in same ciphertext, therefore patterns in data is not obscured. The diagram shown earlier corresponds to ECB mode.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC):** in this mode the ciphertext of the current block depends on the ciphertext of the previous block. The plaintext of the current block is XOR'd with the ciphertext of the previous block before being encrypted. The first block is XOR'd with the initialisation vector. In many modes, including CBC, the IV is usually generated randomly and is the same size as the cipher block size. The IV is usually not kept secret and is stored together with the ciphertext because it is needed for decryption. In almost any encryption mode, including CBC, an IV must only be used for one message encrypted with the given encryption key and must not be reused for another message. Therefore, we can say that an IV is usually a *nonce*. \n",

    "**Other Modes:** includes CTR, GCM (recommended), PCBC, CFB, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding Types\n",
    "**Public Key Cryptographic Standard #7 (PKCS7):** works by appending $N$ bytes with the value of $chr(N)$, where $N$ is the number of bytes required to make the final block of data the same size as the block size. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/PKCS7.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "PKCS7 padding has the advantage that it encodes the length of padding, thus indirectly encoding the length of the useful plaintext data in the last block. Hence, the exact length of the whole plaintext data does not need to be transmitted along with the data. If the plaintext is multiple of block size, an additional block of just padding is added to the plaintext and then encoded. Thus, after decryption the last byte is read and $N$ number of bytes are considered padding."
