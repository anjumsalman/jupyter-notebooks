    "## Overview\n",
    "Symmetric encryption requires both parties to know the common secret key. In absence of a secure communication channel sharing this secret key becomes prone to eavesdropping. Asymmetric encryption is utilised in such scenario. It involves two keys a **public key** and a **private key**. The public key can be shared freely and is used to encrypt the plaintext. Private key is secret and is used to decrypt the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymmetric enryption offers **confidentiality**, but not **authentication**, **integrity** or **non-repudiation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RSA Internals\n",
    "RSA is the most commonly known asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric crypto algorithms depend upon trapdoor functions which are easy to calculate one way but very difficult the other way round.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA utilises the fact that it is eaasy to multiple two large prime numbers, but difficult to determine factors of the resultant product. The following example illustrates how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a pair of number $(5,14)$ which is the public key using which we will encrypt plaintext $B$. The steps involved are:\n",
    "1. Convert $B$ to a number, lets say $B$ is represented by number $2$\n",
    "2. Calculate $2^{5}(mod\\ 14)$. It is equal to $32\\ mod\\ 14 = 4$\n",
    "3. Convert $4$ back to letter which is $D$. Therefore the ciphertext is $D$\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt, we need the private key which in this case is the pair $(11, 14)$. To decrypt the ciphertext:\n",
    "1. Convert $D$ to a number, lets say $D$ is represented by number $4$\n",
    "2. Calculate $4^{11}(mod\\ 14)$. It is equal to $4194304\\ mod\\ 14 = 2$\n",
    "3. Convert $2$ back to letter which is $B$. Therefore the plaintext is $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "How did we come up with the public and private keypair?\n",
    "1. Take two large prime numbers and multiply them. In this case we can take small primes for illustration.  \n",
    "   $p=2, q=7, N=p\\times q=14$\n",
    "2. $p$ and $q$ are kept secret, $N$ is made public (along with $E$ explained l)\n",
    "3. Calculate $\\upphi(N)$ which is count of numbers coprime with $14$ between $1$ and $14$.  \n",
    "   The numbers are $1$, $3$, $5$, $9$, $11$ and $13$. So $\\upphi(N)=6$ which is same as $(p-1)(q-1)$\n",
    "4. The number $E$, part of public key must a) $1 < E < \\upphi(N)$ and b) coprime with $N$ and $\\upphi(N)$.  \n",
    "   Out of $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$ only last satisfies both. So $E=5$\n",
    "5. The number $D$, part of private key must satisfy $D\\cdot E (mod\\ \\upphi(N)) = 1$ which is $D\\cdot 5 (mod\\ 6) = 1$.  \n",
    "   There can be multiple solutions to this like $5$, $11$, etc. We choose $D=11$.\n",
    "6. Thus the pairs are $(5,14)$ and $(11,14)$\n",

    "To reach same security level of AES-256, RSA key needs to be 15360 bits long. Asymmetric encryption/decryption is also slower than symmetric equivalent and performance drops with increase in key size. Longer keys also take longer to generate. For RSA, the generated ciphertext is as long as the key. Thus, we have a trade-off between security and performance. What is the acceptable compromise? What RSA key size do we choose?
