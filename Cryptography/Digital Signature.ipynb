    "- **Authentication:** the message is from the claimed sender\n",

    "- **Non-repudiation:** the sender cannot deny that they produced the signature\n",

    "A digital sugnature is generated using a private key and verified using the corresponding public key. Usually, the message is first hashed (except for EdDSA) using some cryptographic hash function and then the signature is applied on the digest. This makes sense as we know algorithm like RSA can only hash limited volume of data.\n",

    "### RSA\n",
    "In addition to encrypting data, RSA can also be used to generate and verify digital signature. It is the slowest algorithm to sign but fastest to verify. RSA also produces the largest signature (same size as the key). The process is similar to encrypting the hash using the private key and verifying involves decrypting the signature and matching the hash.\n",

    "2. A prime number $p$ which represents the range of allowed numbers\n",
    "3. Base point $G$ which is a starting point on the curve\n",
    "4. Order $n$ representing total number of points that can be generated starting at $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate private key $d$, we just pick a secure random number between $[1, n-1]$  \n",
    "To generate the public key, we do elliptic curve point multiplication $Q = d\\times G$. $Q$ is also a point on the curve.\n",
