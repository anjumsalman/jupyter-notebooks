    "## Introduction\n",
    "DNS is a hierarchical distributed database that contains mappings of DNS domain names to data. DNS enables us to use hierarchical, friendly names to easily locate computers and other resources on an IP network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early days, the job of DNS was done by hosts file, however, it was not scalable. Network administrators entered names and IP addresses into hosts, and computers used the file for name resolution. DNS replaces the Hosts file with a distributed database that implements a hierarchical naming system."

    "Or Top Level Domain, lie beneath the Root of the Internet domain namespace. There are three types of top-level domains:\n",
    "1. **Organizational domains:** These are named by using a 3-character code that indicates the primary function or activity of the organizations contained within the DNS domain. Generally used by US government departments.\n",
    "2. **Geographical domains:** These are named by using the 2-character country/region codes.\n",
    "3. **Reverse domains:** This is a special domain, named in-addr.arpa, that is used for IP address-to-name mappings.\n",
    "\n",

The organizations to which an Internet name authority delegates a portion of the domain namespace are then responsible for naming the computers and network devices within their assigned domain and its subdivisions."

In its simplest form, a record is basically a single mapping between a resource and a name.\n",

    "Computers that run DNS server programs containing DNS database information about the DNS domain tree structure. A zone is a contiguous portions of the DNS namespace for which the server is authoritative.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS servers store information about no zones, one zone, or multiple zones. When a DNS server receives a DNS query, it attempts to locate the requested information by retrieving data from its local zones. If this fails because the server is not authoritative for the DNS domain requested and thus does not have the data for the requested domain, the server can check its cache, communicate with other DNS servers to resolve the request, or refer the client to another DNS server that might know the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS servers use a mechanism called round-robin or load sharing, to share and distribute loads for network resources. Round-robin rotates the order of resource record data returned in a query answer in which multiple RRs exist of the same RR type for a queried DNS domain name. Consider the example below:\n",

    "## Record Types\n",
    "Within the zone file, we can have many different record types such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Origin and TTL\n",
    "Whenever we have `$ORIGIN` line in a zone file, this is a shortcut that lets us know that any unterminated hostname references following that line should be presumed to end in the argument following `$ORIGIN`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ORIGIN domain.com.\n",
    "$TTL 5m\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`$TTL` means that remote DNS resolvers should only cache records retrieved from this zone for five minutes before requesting them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOA Record\n",
    "The Start of Authority, or SOA, record is a mandatory record in all zone files. It must be the first real record in a file (although $ORIGIN or $TTL specifications may appear above). Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "domain.com.  IN SOA   ns1.domain.com. admin.domain.com. (\n",
    "                          12083           ; serial number\n",
    "                          3h              ; refresh interval\n",
    "                          30m             ; retry interval\n",
    "                          3w              ; expiry period\n",
    "                          1h              ; negative TTL\n",
    "                          )\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first argument is the hostname the record applies to—in this case, `domain.com.`. If we had set `$ORIGIN` as `com.` earlier, we could have set this first argument as `domain`. This hostname example as \"unterminated\" because it doesn't end in a dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument `IN SOA` sands for internet and start of authority respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third argument is an FQDN, and it should be the FQDN of the primary name server for the domain itself. The next argument isn't a FQDN at all, rather it's a perverse way of rewriting an email address (since @ in zone file is a reserve character). We'll ignore rest of the paremeters for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NS Record\n",
    "The NS or “name server” DNS record type is used to specify the authoritative name servers for a domain. It tells DNS resolvers which servers to contact when it's looking for DNS records for that domain name. Each NS record specifies the name of one authoritative name server for a particular DNS zone. Each zone file must have one SOA record and atleast two NS record.\n",
    "```\n",
    "        IN  NS     ns1.domain.com.\n",
    "        IN  NS     ns2.domain.com.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we haven't specified the domain name itself on either line—this is because we've inherited it from the SOA record above. We started that line with `domain.com.`. Since we haven't specified another hostname, these new NS records also apply to that hostname by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note: when we see @ as a hostname in a zone file, that just means we're using the bare $ORIGIN without any further qualifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A and AAAA Record\n",
    "Both of these records map a host to an IP address. The “A” record is used to map a host to an IPv4 IP address, while “AAAA” records are used to map a host to an IPv6 address. Format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "host     IN      A       IPv4_address\n",
    "host     IN      AAAA    IPv6_address\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our SOA record called out a primary server at “ns1.domain.com”, we would have to map this to an address to an IP address:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ns1      IN      A        111.222.111.222\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to using the following FQDN:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ns1.domain.com.      IN      A      111.222.111.222\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other concrete example (always map www):\n",
    "```\n",
    "www     IN  A       222.222.222.222\n",
    "domain.com.     IN  A       222.222.222.222\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have the option of resolving anything that under this domain that is not defined explicitly to this server too. We can do this with the “*” wild card:\n",
    "```\n",
    "*       IN  A       222.222.222.222\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNAME Record\n",
    "CNAME records define an alias for canonical name for your server (one defined by an A or AAAA record). For instance, we could have an A name record defining the “server1” host and then use the “www” as an alias for this host:\n",
    "```\n",
    "server1     IN  A       111.111.111.111\n",
    "www         IN  CNAME   server1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### CAA Record\n",
    "CAA records are used to specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue SSL/TLS certificates for your domain. As of September 8, 2017 all CAs are required to check for these records before issuing a certificate. If no record is present, any CA may issue a certificate. Otherwise, only the specified CAs may issue certificates. CAA records can be applied to single hosts, or entire domains.\n",
    "```\n",
    "example.com.      IN      CAA      0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "A complete zone file (@ refers to $ORIGIN):\n",
    "```\n",
