    "## Cache Strategy\n",
    "### Read Through\n",
    "As per this strategy, for a read:\n",
    "- Check if data exists in the cache\n",
    "- If it does (cache hit), the cache retreives it from memory and returns response\n",
    "- If it doesn't (cache miss), the cache retreives it from the database, updates the cache and then returns the response\n",
    "\n",
    "The cache hit or miss is transparent to the user:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "User user = cache.get(\"Sam\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cache like `Ehcache` and `Hazelcast` support this. Distributed cache like `NCache` also do. Redis doesn't support this directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache Aside\n",
    "Similar to read through with the difference being that the process is not automated. As per this strategy, for a read:\n",
    "- Check if data exists in the cache\n",
    "- If it does (cache hit), the the cache retreives it from memory and returns response\n",
    "- If it doesn't (cache miss), the applicattion retreives it from the database, updates the cache and then returns the response\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "User user = cache.get(\"Sam\");\n",
    "if (user == null) {\n",
    "    user = db.getUser(\"Sam\");     // Manually fetch from DB\n",
    "    cache.set(\"Sam\", user);       // Manually store in cache\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This strategy provides more flexibility over how cache is populated, but involves more work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write Through\n",
    "As per this strategy writes are made to cache and the cache synchronously writes to the database. Write is considered complete when write to both cache and database succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the advantage that the cache and database remains in sync. The disadvantage is that writes are slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache like `Ehcache` and `Hazelcast` support this. Distributed cache like `NCache` also do. Redis doesn't support this directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write Behind\n",
    "Write behind is similar to write through the difference being write is made asynchronously. This means that writes are faster at the cost of consistency. Data is eventually consistent."
