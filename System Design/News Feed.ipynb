    "## Overview\n",
    "News feed is a list of user generated (people connected to user) content like text, image, audio, likes, status update, etc tailored for a user to consume. Exmples include Facebook news feed, Instagram feed, Twitter timeline and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system needs to provide 2 main features:\n",
    "- ability to publish a post\n",
    "- ability to view connection's post\n",
    "\n",
    "How to order the post? There can be multiple ways:\n",
    "- chronological order\n",
    "- order by post score. Score can be generated by combining multiple factors like date time, post type, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "A post can contain only text or text + image/video.\n",

    "      While this model ensures very fast retrieval of feeds, it has some issues. It scales linearly with the number of connections (N). If a user has 10 million connections, 10 million writes occur per post. Moreover write happens for inactive users who rarely login. This wastes space and compute power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fanout on Read:** the feed is not pre-computed. The heavy lifting happens only when the user explicitly fetches their news feed. The content is \"pulled\" by the client on request.  \n",
