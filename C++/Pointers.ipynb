    "Numbers we genrally write are in base 10. Binary numbers have base 2, hexadecimals have base 16.  \n",
    "A number in decimal can be converted to base 2 by repeatedly dividing it with 2 and noting the remainder.  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "$$16\\ mod\\ 2 = 0\\\\  \n",

    "Hexadecimal system uses the symbols 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F to represent a number. For example the number 65 in hexadecimal would be obtained by repeatedly dividing by 16.  \n",

    "**One's Complement:** in this system 12 is 0000 1100. Whereas -12 is 1000 1100. But the problem is that zero is represented by either 1000 0000 or 0000 0000.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Two's Complement:** in this system we first invert all digits, then add 1. For example on inverting all digits of 12 we get 1111 1100. On adding 1, we get 1111 1101. Zero always has 1 representation."
