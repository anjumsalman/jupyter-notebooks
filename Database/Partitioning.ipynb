    "## Partitioning\n",
    "Refers to dividing data into multiple pieces which can be stored, accessed and managed separately. It offers the following benefits:\n",
    "- **Scalability:** as the database size grows, it is not possible to store all of it on one node. We can partition data and store partitions on separate nodes.\n",
    "- **Performance:** as we spread data across multiple nodes, we reduce read contention. Requests to database are now handled by multiple machines.\n",
    "- **Availability:** even if one node goes down, there are other nodes to server data. Partitioning is often combined with data replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning does not require partitions to be stored on different nodes. Infact creating partitions using `PARTITION BY` clause creates partitions that reside on the same node. When partitions are spread across multiple nodes this is termed as **sharding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when partitioning involves only one node, it can be beneficial:\n",
    "- improved querying performance by skipping irrelevant partitions\n",
    "- query can be run parallaly across multiple partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal vs Vertical Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partition Method\n",
    "When we partition data, one the main considerations is to ensure that data is distributed equally among the partitions. One way to do this is to randomly store data in different nodes. But this makes reading data slow - we don't know which partition holds the data we are looking for; so we need to search in all partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partition by Range\n",
    "The table is partitioned into “ranges” defined by a key, with no overlap between the ranges of values assigned to different partitions. It is upto the database administrator to define the ranges in a way that partitions are equally filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Postgres, do define partition by range:"
