    "- **One to one:** A car engine has one serial number\n",
    "- **One to many:** A customer can have multiple credit cards, but each credit card belongs to one customer\n",
    "- **Many to one:** One to many looked from the other side.\n",

    "\n",
    "Relationship can have *partial* or *total participation*. Partial participation example: A customer has bought 0 products, he is a customer just because the store has his information. Total participation: an author has written atleast 1 book. Total participation is represented using double line.\n",
