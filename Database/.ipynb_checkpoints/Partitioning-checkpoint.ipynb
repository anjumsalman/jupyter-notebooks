    "Partitioning is a generic term for dividing data across tables or databases. We can partition vertically or horizontally as shown:  \n",

    "Horizontal partitioning is called **sharding** and it is the one that is supported by MySQL (no vertical partitioning in MySQL).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- now able to accomodate large amount of data by splitting it across machines\n",
    "- better reselience in case of failure\n",
    "- faster query in some cases"

    "The problem with this is if we add new machines then how to we distribute now? We may have to update our hashing logic, redistribute all data, etc\n",

    "In MySQL we can define hash based partitioning in the following manner:\n",
