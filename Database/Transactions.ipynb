    "## Overview\n",
    "A transaction is a facility provided by databases to combine multiple database read and writes into one logical unit executed atomically - either the entire transaction fails or it completes. It simplifies reasoning about application state since no partial failure happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ACID\n",
    "Safety guarantees provided by transactions can be consolidated into one acronym - ACID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomicity\n",
    "In general programming terminology, atomicity in a multthreaded environment means that operation executed by a thread cannot result in a half-finished state from the point of view of other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomicity in ACID is unrelated to concurrency. It means that when multiple writes are made by a client and a fault occurs midway, either the entire transaction is completed or none of it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without atomicity it becomes difficult to determine what change went through and what didn't. Retrying in such scenario can lead to twice the number of changes than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistency\n",
    "Similar to atomicity, consistency means different things in different contexts. In case of database transaction, it means that there are provisions to enforce invariants about data being stored, thereby ensuring that database remains valid and rule-compliant before and afer transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is by declaring *constraints* such as foreign key constraint, uniqueness constraints, triggers, etc. However, it is also application programmers responsibility to define transactions in a way that preserve consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolation\n",
    "Accounts for scenarios when the database is accessed by multiple clients at the same time. When multiple concurrent writes are happening, there is a possibility of race-condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation in context of transaction means that one transaction is isolated from other. Concurrent transactions appear to have executed serially - like `synchronized` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation has performance penalty, therefore there are different levels of isolation provided by databases. Weaker isolation levels allow concurrent transactions to interfer with each other in limited ways but improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Isolation levels](./images/kAIV6an.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Durability\n",
    "Refers to promise that once a transaction is committed, and data that was written will be retained even in case of failures like database crash. This means that system call like `fsync` is used to ensure that memory buffer is flushed and content is written to the disk\n",
    "\n",
    "If the database is replicated, this would mean that writes are acknowledged by some number of replica nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect durability though doesn't exist - if the disk corrupts and backups get destroyed there is nothing a database can do."

    "## Isolation Levels\n",
    "If only read-only statements are involved, there is no concurrency issue. Concurrency issue pops up when:\n",
    "- one transaction reads data written by other\n",
    "- two transactions modify the same data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read Committed\n",
    "This isolation level promises:\n",
    "- No **dirty read**: while reading data from the database, only the data that was committed is read. To simplify, any write made during a transaction is visible to others only when it commits. This ensures that data is not read in partial state. If dirty read was allowed, and the transaction was rolled back, this would mean that rolled back data was read by other process.\n",
    "- No **dirty write**: while writing to the database, only data that was committed is overwritten. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Read Committed](./images/read_committed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "To prevent *dirty-read*, implementation is done in two ways:\n",
    "1. **Shared Lock:** to read a row, database acquires a lock for it and holds it till the transaction completes. This is the older way and used by database like SQL Server.\n",
    "2. **MVCC (Multi Version Concurrency Control):** database maintains multiple versions of a row. Each transaction is given a consistent view (a \"snapshot\") of the data at a specific point in time, determined by a transaction ID or timestamp. This is statement level MVCC, so two different `SELECT` statements within the same transaction might get different results. Postgres and Oracle utilise this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent *dirty-write*, a transaction must aquire lock for the affected rows.\n",

Therefore one of the transactions has to wait for the other to commit. However, in this case T2's view of the database doesn't reflect the changes just made by T1. Database like Postgres detects that T2’s view of the world is now invalid (because it missed T1’s committed changes but touched overlapping data). This results in an error being thrown (Postgres returns \"ERROR: could not serialize access due to concurrent update\") and T2 is rolledback. The ideal scenario would be to retry T2. Which is why the advise is to retry transactions on failure when repeatable read mode is used. Lost updates therefore doesn't impact repeatable read mode.\n",

    "**Scenario 3:** *lost update* is not an issue in repeatable read mode as conflicting writes result in error as stated above. One transaction will error out in the example below:"
