    "### Staging Changes\n",

    "```sh\n",
    "git add main.py\n",

    "In context of git, an `untracked file` is a file which is newly added and not being managed by git. If this file is added to staging area (and not removed) at some point, it becomes `tracked`. We use `git status` to see what files are tracked and what tracked files have been modified since last commit. It also lists all untracked files.\n",

    "The above code switches the current branch and replaces the working directory with HEAD (which now points to the latest commit of the new branch). Checkout may fail if we have some changes in either the working directory or the staging area. So we need to either commit or stash or use `--force` option.\n",

    "![Fast forward](https://i.imgur.com/nAP1Vug.png)  \n",
    "- **Three-way merge:** In this scenario, a fast-forward is not possible because both branches to be merged have updates since they diverged from a common point. Those divergences have to be resolved before the merge can be completed.  \n",
    "![3 way merge](https://i.imgur.com/2bFMpQo.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Merge operation can be deleted by doing a `git reset`. **ORIG_HEAD** contains the SHA1 value of the commit that was current before the last merge operation. So we can do `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dealing with merge conflicts:** One of the first things to understand is that merge operations are states in Git. This means that when the operations are started, Git enters a state that disallows changing contexts until the operation is complete. We can abort a merge operation by\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git merge --abort\n",

    "\n",
    "For any files that have conflicts, those conflicts are marked with the Git conflict markers (≪≪≪ and ≫≫≫). Now, it is up to the user to resolve the conflicts that Git couldn't merge, and complete the operation. You cannot exit the merge state without resolving conflict in the affected file. `git status` lets us know which files have merge conflict. It is better to use a visual merge conflict resolve tool. In tortoise git the workflow is like:  \n",
