    "An activity provides the window in which the app draws its UI. Typically, one activity in an app is specified as the *main activity*, which is the first screen to appear when the user launches the app.\n",

    "- **onStart()** : this is when the UI becomes visible to the user. Things initialised here should be freed in onStop.\n",
    "- **onResume()** : at this point activity is at the top of the activity stack. Core app functionality is defined here. Things initialised here should be freed in onPause.\n",
    "- **onPause()** : activated each time activity loses focus. For example, back/recents button was pressed. Also note that in multi-windowed mode, the inactive window is in paused state. Do not use this method to save application data or make network calls or execute database transactions.\n",
    "- **onStop()** : activity is completely hidden now\n",
    "- **onRestart()** : invoked whenever activity in stopped state is restarted.\n",
    "- **onDestroy()** : the system invokes this callback before an activity is destroyed.\n",
