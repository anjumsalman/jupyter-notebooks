    "We use something called as **shims** and **polyfills**. Shims intercepts API calls and creates an abstract layer between the caller and the target. For example, ECMAScript 3 does not have `Date.now`. To support this ECMAScript 5 feature,\n",

    "Polyfilling is really just a specialized version of shimming. Polyfill is about implementing missing features in an API, whereas a shim wouldnâ€™t necessarily be as much about implementing missing features as it is about correcting features. So while shims are used for covering up old sins, polyfills are used for bringing future enhancements back in time.

    "Sometimes we may come across completely new language syntax, such as class construct in ES6. In that case we use a transpiler like **Babel**. It will transpile code written in higher version to lower version. Simply transpiling is not enough, we may also need polyfills. Babel does the task of polyfilling as well."
